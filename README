This program pretty-prints a Latex table, given a list of records.  We have
used it for spotting patterns in combinatorial data, but presumably there are
many other uses.

You call it as follows:
    ./latexpivot.py data.py instructions.py >output.tex

data.py should define a python dictionary called "data".  Probably the keys of this dictionary are going to be tuples of integers, and the values are the things to print (perhaps a list of stuff?)

The instructions file should define two classes -- datapoint and table.  They define the way that the data should be interpreted and printed, as well as some parameters of the table.
