This program pretty-prints a Latex table, given a list of records.  We have
used it for spotting patterns in combinatorial data, but presumably there are
many other uses.

The records should be in the format of a python dictionary, whose keys are all n-tuples.

The instructions file contains two classes -- datapoint and table.  They define the way that the data should be interpreted and printed, as well as some parameters of the table.
